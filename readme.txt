**Why my news content out of range?**  
In front end widget area, if you see any news content out of area or invisible, it because of height and width of the widget, so you should arrange width and height of the widget in widget configuration area to good look. In default I have fixed width: 180px and height: 100px.  
  
**Can I change the scroll manner from vertical to horizontal?**  
No,
